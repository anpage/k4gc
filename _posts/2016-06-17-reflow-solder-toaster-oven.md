title: Reflow Oven Toaster Oven Controller
---
It looks like everybody is making these things at home, even though you can buy a new Chinese reflow oven on Ebay for less than three hundred dollars.  It looks like a good one... all ready to go.  But then, I would not have the challenge of making one of my own design.

I have never done reflow before but I have soldered smd's to circuit boards with pretty good success.  I also have access to a hot air rework system with an assortment of nozzles where I work.  It never was that hard.  I just takes some care not to short out pads or get things too hot.
